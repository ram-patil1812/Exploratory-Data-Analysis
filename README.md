# Netflix Movies & TV Shows

Exploratory data analysis by using pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn

I did this project of EDA on "Netflix Movies and TV Shows" Dataset, Basically I found this dataset on kaggle
here is dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows

The purpose of this project is to find out trends of movies and tv shows on streaming platform using data visualization technique and statistical method.

This dataset consist of information about the media which is streaming on netflix platform this data set consist of media like TV shows & Movie, title, director,cast,
country,rating genre, release data, duration etc.

For Data processing, Data cleaning & data manupulation i used libraries like python Numpy and Pandas. For Data visualization & Analysis i Used libraries like 
matplotlib & saeborn.

So while doing EDA I came with some question and found some informative insight thrrough data manipulation and visualization.

I found challenging in this project is that there are lots of categorical datapoint which not in structured way so i handle them and make it suitable for ease of 
visualization & analysis. Other datapoint are dates and duration which is not in pandas timestamp so I convert them for better use in further analysis. It is real time data of streaming platform Netflix which is decent dataset for visualization and analysis.

I also try to visualize & analyze in tableau and create a dashboard.
